> All in one micro-service framework with minimum dependencies and simplistic design. Most suitable for distributed applications and applications that serve multiple endpoints. The main concept behind _Kaptan_ framework is using services as parts to build application.

## Available Services
| Package | Repository | Description |
| ---------- | ---------- |:-----------:|
[kaptan-http](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kaptan-http) | [ibrahimduran/node-kaptan-http](https://github.com/ibrahimduran/node-kaptan-http) | Simple HTTP service with utilities. |

## Getting Started
You can install _Kaptan_ framework and its services easily from NPM using your favorite tool. 
```sh
$ npm install --save kaptan
# or
$ yarn add kaptan
```
TypeScript users don't need to install any package for type definitions, they're served in the main package.

### Creating an application
First parameter of `Kaptan.constructor` is label for the application. Having a label prevents mess in logs when you have multiple instances of kaptan.
```js
import { Kaptan } from 'kaptan';

const kaptan = new Kaptan('my-app');
```
Or feel free to extend `Kaptan` class:
```js
import { Kaptan } from 'kaptan';

class MyApp extends Kaptan {
  constructor() {
    super();

    // (lines below are only visible to who believes in unicorns)
    // My secret code - start


    // My secret code - end
  }
}

const app = new MyApp();
```

### Adding services to application
Services can be installed from NPM. You can use `Kaptan.use` method to add service and service options.
```js
import { CustomService } from 'kaptan-foo-bar';

kaptan.use(CustomService, { XYZ: false });
```

### Starting application
This will fire up application and create service instances.
```js
kaptan.start();
```

### Developing Services
Services are created by extending Service class. _Service_ constructor takes _kaptan_ intance as first parameter and options object as second. Also `kaptan`, `logger` and `options` properties get set in extended _Service_ constructor.
```js
import { Service } from 'kaptan';

class MyService extends Service {
  constructor(kaptan, options) {
    super(kaptan, {
      XYZ: 'some_default_val',
      ...options
    });

    // theese are automatically set
    console.log(this.kaptan);
    console.log(this.options);
    console.log(this.logger);

    // service dependencies/injections
    const fooBar = kaptan.services.spawn('FooBar');
  }
}
```
You can use `kaptan.services.spawn` method to access service instances.

## Network
> Kaptan framework comes with a built-in Network service to simplify networking. All features of network service is async/await - promise compatible. It currently supports three protocols for sending packets; _Request_/_Response_ for sending request and receiving response synchronously (using promises) and _Raw_ for sending data without waiting for response. 

Informations below are just a brief description for understanding the concept. Don't forget to check documentation to get more information about classes or methods.

### Using the service
Kaptan package exports _Network_ namespace which contains _Network_ service. So you'll need to add `Network.Network` as service.

```js
import { Network } from 'kaptan';

kaptan.use(Network.Network, { PORT: 5000 });
```



### Packets, packet handlers and packet filters
`Network.Packet` is basically a data holder class with serialization logic in it. `Network.PacketHandler` instances can be passed to sockets and network service itself. By default, every one of packet handlers run when a packet arrives to the local socket but you can add filters to the handler using the `Network.PacketFilter` class.

Also you can use literal objects to create `PacketHandler` and `PacketFilter` instances in order simplify usage.

```js
const filter = Network.PacketFilter.from({ ref: 'myPacket' });

const handler = new Network.PacketHandler({
    filter: filter,
    onParsed(socket, packet) {
    }
    
    onReceive(socket, raw) {
    }
});
```

### Sockets
`Network.Socket` is wrapper for [_net_](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html)'s socket object. You can pass packet handlers to sockets as mentioned above. There are two main methods in socket; `wait(filter)` and `send(packet)`. Since `wait` method returns a promise, you can create synchronized communications between server and client with power of async/await syntax of ES2017.

```js
const filter = new Network.PacketFilter()
    .require('message');
    
const response = await socket.wait(filter);
socket.send({ data: { message: response.data.message } }); // mirror message
```
